# Lottery Data Pre-Processing and Analysis

This repository contains scripts to pre-process lottery data from an Excel file and generate potential winning combinations based on statistical analysis.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `pip` package manager

### Create and Activate Virtual Environment

1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**

   ```
   python3 -m venv env
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

   - On Windows:

     ```
     .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

### Install Requirements

Install the required packages using `pip`:

```
python3 -m pip install openpyxl
```

### Running the Pre-processing Script

1. Place your Excel file (e.g., `input.xlsx`) in the same directory as the scripts.

2. Run the pre-processing script:

   ```
   python3 pre_process.py
   ```

### Running the Main Script

1. Make sure the `preprocessed_data.json` file generated by the pre-processing script is in the same directory as the main script.

2. Run the main script:

   ```
   python3 main.py
   ```

### Expected Behavior

- The pre-processing script will read the `input.xlsx` file, process the lottery data, and generate a JSON file (`preprocessed_data.json`) containing the top numbers for each position and the overall top numbers.
- The main script will read the `preprocessed_data.json` file and use the data to generate and rank potential winning combinations.

### Data Extracted from the Excel File

- The pre-processing script extracts two sets of 6 balls from each row (draw 1 and draw 2).
- It calculates the frequency of each ball at each position (1st to 6th) across all draws.
- It identifies the top 10 most frequently occurring balls for each position and the overall top 10 balls based on their total frequency.
- The data is stored in a JSON file with the following structure:

```json
{
    "top_balls_per_position": [
        {"position_1": [{"ball_number": 1, "ball_frequency": 5}, ...]},
        {"position_2": [{"ball_number": 2, "ball_frequency": 7}, ...]},
        ...
    ],
    "overall_top_balls": [
        {"ball_number": 1, "ball_frequency": 20},
        {"ball_number": 2, "ball_frequency": 18},
        ...
    ]
}
```
